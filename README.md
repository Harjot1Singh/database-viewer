## Proofs for Bani

The below table lists various files used in correcting the bani portion of the database. The term *proof* does not indicate a 100% hard-truth. Over the many years in Sikh history, there have been multiple variations of the same text, even by the same publisher (e.g. SGPC), from mistakes in transpiling, incorrect printer set-ups, and human error. Therefore, documenting these multiplicities for the sake of transparency, reproducibility, and research purposes is encouraged.

If one would like to proofread the database, they may click on the corresponding link for a PDF. The compare the proof against the source (Shabad OS Database) using the online viewer.
